- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?
    The lifecycle method is the only thing I can think of that would be a reason to use class comps over functional. Instead of useState or useEffect, you can be more specific with each element of the lifecycle method. 

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.
    The main 3 lifecycle methods are componentDidMount which happens on birth of the component, componentDidUpdate which updates the component everytime the method is called, and componentWillUnmount which is the death of the component.

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
    The purpose of the custom hook is to be a DRY developer, you can reuse the same hook over and over within the same code.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?
    It is important for many reasons but the main 3 are reliability of the code we wrote, trusting others' codes, and to test full functionality before moving to the production phase.
